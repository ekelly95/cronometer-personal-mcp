/**
 * `dailysummary.csv` — the only source of nutrient data in the export, and the
 * one file that is a wide aggregate rather than a stream of events.
 *
 * Two things it does differently from the other five:
 *
 * It uses `Date` where everything else uses `Day`. DATA_MODEL.md §2 flags this as
 * a real inconsistency that a generic column mapper silently drops, so the name
 * is stated here rather than shared.
 *
 * Its `Group` column holds diary groups *plus* a `Total` row per day. The Total
 * is lifted out into its own field instead of being left among the groups —
 * summing a day that still contains it double-counts everything (DATA_MODEL.md
 * §5 rule 1), and with the two separated that mistake is not available.
 *
 * Nutrient columns are looked up by name and are individually optional. If an
 * export drops one, that nutrient is `Missing` everywhere and the absence is
 * reported once; refusing the whole file over one column would throw away sixty
 * good ones. Extra columns we do not recognise are ignored.
