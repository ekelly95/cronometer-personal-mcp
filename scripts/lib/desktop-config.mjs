// Registers this MCP server in Claude Desktop's configuration file.
//
// Claude Desktop has no CLI for this, so its config has to be rewritten in place —
// and that file is not just a server list. It holds Desktop's own preferences,
// nested several levels deep. Losing one is losing something that was never ours,
// and a backup is a consolation rather than a defence.
//
// This lives in scripts/ and not src/ on purpose. The server's standing property is
// that src/parse/export-files.ts is the only code in it that opens a file; a
// setup-time tool must not weaken that claim.
//
// It is shared by the Windows and macOS setup scripts rather than written twice.
// Two implementations of logic this fiddly drift, and the copy that drifts is the
// one nobody is running today.
