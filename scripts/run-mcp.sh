# Launcher for macOS and other Unix systems. Mirrors scripts/run-mcp.ps1 step for
# step, and deliberately keeps the same order and the same refusals: a corrupted
# configuration should fail loudly here rather than reach the network with rubbish in
# it, and that reasoning is not platform-specific.
#
# The one genuine difference is where the password lives. Windows encrypts it with
# DPAPI and stores the ciphertext in live-config.json; here it is in the login
# Keychain and the config file holds no secret at all.
#
# POSIX sh on purpose. macOS ships bash 3.2 from 2007, and nothing below needs more
# than sh gives.
